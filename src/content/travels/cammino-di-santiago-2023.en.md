## Journey

The **English Way of St. James** is the one that, more than all others, brings back the most beautiful memories.  
Along this path I found the true spirit of the Way of St. James: sincere encounters, spontaneous sharing and moments that stay with you. I met wonderful people and carry with me memories I know will never leave me.

## First Stage: Ferrol – Neda

The journey begins in **Ferrol**, a port city in northern Spain. The sun is rising, the air is fresh and I'm ready to set off on this solo journey. I head towards the starting point, a small information center inside the port. On the wall there's a painting depicting the symbols of Santiago: pilgrims, an arrow and a shell.

Not far away I see the **first yellow arrow** with a **scallop shell** next to it. It's the sign that marks the way. I'm on the right path.  
A milestone confirms everything: **119 km to Santiago de Compostela**. The journey has officially begun.

I leave alone. I don't meet other pilgrims, the path is mostly asphalted, crosses the city and runs alongside the sea. In the early morning hours Ferrol still seems asleep: few shops open, few people around.  
After a few hours I arrive at a park that begins to come alive with families. Here I finally meet other pilgrims with backpacks. There aren't many of us, but as always we greet each other with a simple and sincere *"Buen Camino"*, knowing that sooner or later we'll meet again.

The stage is short, serves to warm up the legs. I arrive early at the **pilgrim hostel**, where I meet other walkers. I meet **José**, who helps me book a bed for the night, and other guys who stop only for a break.

After eating a bocadillo in a small local bar and getting dinner — a bag of chips and a banana — I look around a bit. The hostel is immersed in a somewhat neglected lagoon.  
I go back, grab my book and sit under a tree, by the river, reading.

In the evening I witness a beautiful sunset. Time seems to stand still: everything is calm, peaceful, and even the spirit relaxes.  
When the sun goes down I go to bed, slip into my sleeping bag liner, close my eyes… and sleep.

## Second Stage: Neda – Pontedeume

The second day I wake up when it's still dark. I have breakfast with the second banana from the day before, get dressed and set off again. I leave together with other pilgrims, but we quickly get separated. Outside it's dark, it's cool and you need to pay attention to the signs.  
So much so that, for the first time on this journey, I **take the wrong path**.

Fortunately I meet **two Spanish girls**, Sara and Arantxa. We stop, check the map and all three of us realize we're off track. It doesn't matter: a small detour and we're back on the path.

The path leaves the city and enters the woods. It flows quickly. The pilgrims start to be more numerous and some faces I recognize from the night before.

I arrive in **Pontedeume** which is still early and the hostel is closed. I sit on the ground in the square in front of the information center, waiting for the keys. Slowly other pilgrims I met along the path arrive. We greet each other, exchange a few words. Most are Spanish.

At some point José arrives too. He sees me sitting on the ground and — perhaps out of compassion, perhaps out of kindness, or perhaps out of the pure spirit of the Way — asks me if I want to join him for a beer with other female pilgrims.

I accept.  
At the bar Sara and Arantxa are waiting for us, the girls I got lost with in the morning. We introduce ourselves, have a beer, I speak a mixture of Spanish, Italian and English… but we understand each other.  
From that moment **I'm no longer alone**.

After retrieving the keys and leaving my backpack at the hostel, we meet up for lunch. Thanks to the Spanish friends we end up eating **very fresh fish at the market**.  
I don't know if it was the hunger, the serenity, or the happiness of having met new people, but I still remember that taste: razor clams, goose barnacles, scallops and other incredible seafood.

![Market Lunch](https://res.cloudinary.com/dx6hrvg6l/image/upload/v1767472067/pontedeume-01_ogihv5.jpg)

Four beers on the table, shared small plates and lots of laughter.  
It's in moments like this that I feel truly happy.

In the evening we all eat together again and discover that there's the **town festival**. In Spain, somehow, I always find one. And that's also why I love it.  
We walk around the city, watch some shows and then, not too late, we go to sleep making an appointment for the following morning.

## Third Stage: Pontedeume – Betanzos

The third day flies by. I leave early with José, while Sara and Arantxa set off before. We catch up with them shortly after, right at the entrance to the woods.

What I remember most about this day are the **conversations**: a continuous mixing of Spanish and Italian. Sometimes we get stuck, but in the end we always understand each other.  
We talk about family, friends, travels. We share the reasons that brought us there. And so walking becomes lighter.

Mid-morning we stop at a rest stop for pilgrims. Here we meet an American gentleman — I think his name was **John**. He tells us he recently lost his wife and decided, after that pain, to set off for Santiago.

We have a beer together. Then he thanks us, telling us that meeting us was exactly what he had heard so much about the Way of St. James.  
We get a bit emotional. We say goodbye hoping to see him again. Another moment I will always carry with me.

Arrived in **Betanzos** we all sleep in the same hostel. Feet and shoulders start to make themselves felt and a big blister appears on my heel.  
Fortunately Sara and Arantxa are nurses and, more than offering help, they **force me** to get treated.

In the evening we have dinner together, a beer at the bar and then back to the hostel. Meanwhile it starts to rain.

## Fourth Stage: Betanzos – Hospital de Bruma

The fourth stage begins in the rain. I put on my rain gear, cover my backpack and set off. It's a light drizzle that stops after a few kilometers, leaving me completely dry.

Along the way we meet a group of kids from an Italian oratory. **Marta and Javi**, brother and sister from Malaga, also join our group.

This is the longest stage: **28 km**. But in company they flow by without noticing.  
The funniest moment arrives 200 meters from the finish: a **sudden downpour** breaks out. We see the hostel in the distance, speed up our pace, even try to run… but we arrive soaked anyway.

And, as always, as soon as we enter it stops raining.

In the evening we have dinner at the only restaurant in the area, eat early and return to the hostel to recover our energy.

## Fifth Stage: Hospital de Bruma – Sigüeiro

The fifth stage begins at dawn. The sky is overcast, but the sun peeks through the clouds.  
The most beautiful moment arrives at the top of a hill, surrounded by cornfields. The sun rises behind a hill, the sky turns yellow and orange and the corn reflects the light creating a postcard panorama.

We stop to take photos and admire the spectacle.

![Dawn at Bruma](https://res.cloudinary.com/dx6hrvg6l/image/upload/v1764883558/bruma-01_pwfubo.jpg)

Along the way we meet other guys who join us. Arrived in **Sigüeiro**, the group is now large. We're all cheerful, happy and sore.

In the evening we all have dinner together and decide to arrive in **Santiago** the next day, united.

## Sixth Stage: Sigüeiro – Santiago de Compostela

The last stage is the lightest. The legs go forward almost by inertia.  
The more you walk, the more the kilometers decrease. The milestones with the shell now mark less than 20 km. You start thinking about the arrival, retracing everything you've experienced.

We arrive in **Santiago de Compostela** and immediately head towards the cathedral. The square is full of pilgrims coming from every path. The emotions are strong.  
This time there's not just satisfaction. There's also melancholy. The awareness that everything is ending and that I'll have to say goodbye to people with whom I've shared intense days, without knowing them before.

We take the ritual photos in front of the cathedral. We lie down on the asphalt, tired and happy. Everyone stays a bit with their own thoughts.

In the end a smile appears on my face.  
And even today, if I think back to that moment, it's the same smile that returns.

## Second Part: Finisterre Way

After saying goodbye to my Spanish friends it's time to set off again. My journey is not yet over: the final destination is the Finisterre lighthouse, the end of the world.

## First Stage: Santiago de Compostela - Negreira

I wake up when it's still dark. Santiago appears quiet to me, a world away from the chaos that fills it during the day. I walk in silence and leave the city, soon finding myself in a dense forest that's completely dark.
The sun hasn't risen yet and the moonlight doesn't manage to filter through the tree branches. I turn on my iPhone torch to see where I'm putting my feet and avoid tripping over the roots.

After a few kilometers the sun finally rises. I leave the woods and stop at the first bar I find for breakfast. I start the day with pan con jamón y tomate, a tradition now well established on the ways I've walked in Spain.
The sandwich gives me back my energy, my legs respond well and I set off again at a brisk pace.

I reach Ponte Sarela, an ancient stone bridge, historic and symbolic for the Finisterre Way. After crossing the bridge a tiring up-and-down section begins, which my legs were no longer used to. After the flatter first days this stretch makes itself felt, although the truly beautiful views more than make up for it.

In Negreira I stop at a local bar for lunch: pimientos de padrón and croquetas help me recover a bit of energy.

Once I've found the hostel for the night, I discover that in the bed next to mine is a German guy. He tells me about his experience: he walked over 1000 km, starting from the border between Spain and France and crossing the whole of northern Spain to Santiago. I'm left open-mouthed listening to him.

A little later two guys from Trento join us, also arrived from the French Way, done in several stages.
In the evening we all get together in the hostel kitchen: we're a group of pilgrims who've known each other for a few hours. An Italian man cooks pasta, while the German guy makes chicken curry.
We all eat together. The atmosphere is one of those good ones: serene, smiling, happy people. Everyone has walked different paths and lived different experiences, but the mood is the same. Different, yet incredibly united.

## Second Stage: Negreira - Olveiroa

On the second day I also leave early. In Negreira the street lamps are still on. Walking with me are Clarissa and Alessandro, a couple from Trento, and the man who had cooked the pasta the night before.

The sun rises slowly from behind a hill. The pilgrim's shadow stretches on the asphalt and on the walls of the houses. The landscape is spectacular: we cross cornfields and meet many other pilgrims along the path.

After a few kilometers, lying in a hammock, I find again the Austrian guy from the hostel. We greet each other, exchange a few words, joke, laugh… then each of us resumes our own pace.

The day goes by like this, without rush, until we reach Olveiroa. In the evening we all eat together again and then to bed, tired but at peace.

## Third Stage: Olveiroa - Finisterre

The last stage is also the most evocative. We decide to go all the way to Finisterre together. I'm still in the company of my new Italian friends.

One of the most scenic moments is leaving the woods: suddenly the sea appears on the horizon. I realize we're close.

Before reaching the destination, though, we stop at a beach. Everyone had wanted to go for a swim, and so we do. The water is cold, but it refreshes our aching feet and is a real treat.

After the swim we stop at a restaurant for fresh fish. Here too I treat myself to a good seafood meal.
The break is over, we start walking again. We finally reach Finisterre, visit the town and get to the lighthouse. In front of me is the final milestone: km 0.
I've arrived. Finally.
I have a photo taken that captures all the happiness I'm feeling.

![km 0](https://res.cloudinary.com/dx6hrvg6l/image/upload/v1764883558/finisterre-02_aua5pr.jpg)

In the evening I decide to go back to the lighthouse. Here I witness a truly magical moment: the sunset.
The sun goes down on the horizon, the sky turns orange, the air is cool and my spirit is at peace. When the sun disappears completely, people start to applaud. A spontaneous, instinctive applause, as if to thank the spectacle we've just witnessed.

The day is over.
The sun has set.
And my journey, finally, is complete.
